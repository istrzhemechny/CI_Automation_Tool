        "text": "Bascom Palmer receives moonshot project award to support whole eye transplant\nA recent study published in BMC Ophthalmology investigated the efficacy of multiple varieties of intraocular lenses (IOLs) post-cataract surgery.\nGive me some background first.\nThe current treatment norm for cataracts involves phacoemulsification combined with IOL implantation.\nHowever, with a wide array of IOL options, selecting the correct lens for a patient may pose a challenge in the clinic.\nWhich brings us to \u2026\nResearchers here conducted a meta-analysis to comprehensively assess various high-quality IOLs, with a goal of establishing a reliable foundation for selection and enhancing patient care.\nNow, talk about the study.\nInvestigators conducted a systematic search of past clinical trials by assessing data from 2018 to March 15, 2023, from the following databases:\nCochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)\nPubMed\nEmbase\nThis meta-analysis included a total of 28 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that were composed of 2,465 participants.\nWhat were the characteristics of past studies used?\nInclusion criteria of the RCT studies included:\nParticipants over 40 who had cataract surgery in both eyes and the same IOL implanted in both eyes\nControl groups with standard monofocal IOLs and intervention groups with other various IOLs\nPrimary outcome indicators of:\nVisual acuity (VA)\nSpectacle independence and optical quality\nSecondary outcome measures of contrast sensitivity (CS)\nAnd the different IOL types?\nThe following IOL varieties were observed:\nBifocal IOLs\nTrifocal IOLs\nAT LISAtri 839MP (Zeiss)\nFineVision POD F (BVI Medical)\nAcrySof IQ PanOptix (Alcon, Inc.)\nOther new trifocal IOLs\nExtended depth-of-focus (EDOF IOLs)\nEnhanced monofocal IOLs\nFindings?\nStatistical analysis was performed and interventions were ranked using Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA), which \u201cranks intervention efficacy based on cumulative probability, with higher values (closer to 1) signifying greater effectiveness.\u201d\nThe investigators discovered that trifocal IOLs were significantly more effective than monofocal IOLs in uncorrected near VA (SUCRA 89.1%). They also had the best-corrected near visual acuity (BCVA) (SUCRA 81.2%).\nTell me more.\nBased on the data, monofocal IOLs were found to provide better uncorrected-distant VA (UDVA) for patients (SUCRA 95.1%).\nGo on\u2026\nThe authors maintained that multifocal lenses, particularly the trifocal measures display enhancement of presbyopia treatment and spectacle independence. However, trifocal IOLs are associated with lower optical quality.\nEDOF IOLs displayed comparable effectiveness in improving postoperative intermediate visual acuity, and lower CS than trifocals.\nLimitations?\nThe study authors noted that the inclusion of various different studies may open the door to bias through possible discrepancies among RCTs.\nThey also reported that some of the studies had inconsistent definitions and relatively short follow-up times, which may have impacted the overall findings.\nExpert opinion?\nPer the authors of the study, \u201cIn pairwise comparison, all multifocal IOLs were more effective than monofocal IOLs in providing improved vision at intermediate and near distances.\u201d\nThey added that the \u201cfindings underscore the advantages and potential of trifocal, EDOF, and enhanced monofocal IOLs in enhancing visual acuity for presbyopia-correcting cataract surgery.\u201d\nAnything else?\nWhile the authors stated that the findings suggest trifocal lenses as the most effective, they also noted that neuroadaptation\u2014 the ability of the brain to adapt to changes in retinal image quality\u2014 with multifocal IOLs can be time consuming and difficult for patients.\nTake home.\nThe study authors maintained that \u201cmore high-quality, large-sample, multicenter, randomized, double-blind trials are needed to confirm the reliability of the findings.\u201d\nThey concluded: \u201cThe optimal treatment regimen should be determined on an individual patient basis, safety outcomes, and patient and caregiver decisions.\u201d"

        "title": "Bausch + Lomb demos new Opal online ordering platform",
        "text": "Bausch + Lomb demos new Opal online ordering platform\nFresh off its U.S. launch last month, Bausch + Lomb Corporation offered attendees of the 2024 American Academy of Optometry\u2019s (AAO) annual meeting a chance to demo its brand-new e-commerce digital marketplace: Opal.\nLet\u2019s get a rundown on this.\nThe all-in-one digital platform (available via website domain) is designed to help eyecare professionals (ECPs) save on precious clinic time with faster and more convenient ordering of B+L\u2019s eye care products.\nAnd most importantly: Opal\u2019s intended to assist in bridging the all-too-common gap involving patients resorting to third-party sources (in lieu of their ECP) to order eyecare products.\nI like the sound of that. Tell me more.\nAs a \u201ccomplimentary offering\u201d for B+L product-carrying ECPs, Opal can also be accessed by patients, with a range of digital features available:\nOrder tracking and history\nAppointment reminders\nAutomated prescription reminders\nIt\u2019s important to emphasize: Opal is accessible only to B+L participating practices and patients\nHow does it work, exactly?\nTo start, an ECP can personalize their Opal \u201cproduct shop\u201d by setting up their practice\u2019s product catalog of B+L offerings (contact lenses only, currently \u2026 but more on that later).\nIncluded in this customization: Opal\u2019s ability to populate what an ECP is paying for a specific product based on their input of retails for a patient, enabling the ECP to see what profit they would make per contact lens box.\nRelevant discounts for products can also be added in at this point.\nBringing in the patient: The practice\u2019s administrative staff will create and set up a patient\u2019s Opal profile and input their prescription.\nAfter this, a patient can update their password and view their prescription and details on their respective product orders.\nSo tell me: Why should I consider adding this to my practice?\n(We\u2019ll answer this with the assumption that your practice carries B+L products.)\nThe company previously emphasized that Opal is, ideally, intended to help ECPs and their practices not only save on valuable staff time but also assist in reducing\u2014and simplifying\u2014the often burdensome administrative task associated with ordering products for patients.\nThese tasks include:\nOrder processing\nInventory management\nCost comparisons\nSpeaking of cost \u2026\nDuring a demonstration of the digital marketplace during AAO, Mary Catherine Tuttle, business development manager at B+L, told Glance that most ECPs aren\u2019t going to spend the money stocking their in-office shelves and selling retail in their practices.\n\u201cThis is an opportunity for them to get additional revenue just by using the platform,\u201d she said.\nAnd as a bonus: ECPs are able to view how they\u2019re trending in line with their respective goals (ever-changing loyalty and pricing tiers) of reducing the cost of goods or earning quarterly rewards checks based on how their business has grown with B+L.\nPrior to this: ECPs would typically need to check in with their B+L representative.\nIs there a benefit for patients as well?\nThere is! Once a patient has their Opal profile set up by practice staff, they can order contact lens products directly from their ECP\u2019s practice\u2014either while they\u2019re in the office for a clinic visit or from home.\nNote: If a patient chooses to order on their own, their ECP\u2019s administrative staff can email them their prescription information for them to complete on their own time.\nAnd keep in mind: If ordering in-office, a staff member can provide a breakdown (quote sheet) of product pricing based on a patient\u2019s insurance, any potential rewards or benefits they may qualify for (i.e., rebates), as well as a net box price.\nThe key intention with this: More transparency with patients.\nNow to these products: What can be ordered via this platform?\nAt the moment, Opal features the following contact lens brands:\nINFUSE\nULTRA\nBiotrue ONEday\nHowever: In the coming weeks, B+L is looking to add a select number of over-the-counter (OTC) to the digital marketplace, including:\nBLINK eye drops\nNutriTears included\nLUMIFY redness reliever eye drops\nIncluding its specialty products\nSo tell me: How does the ordering process work?\nAs we mentioned, patients can use Opal to order products directly from their ECP (in-office or not).\nOnce ordered, the patient has the option to have their product deliveries shipped directly to their home or their ECP\u2019s practice\u2014for free.\nTake note: Each purchase is also applied toward the company\u2019s Horizon Rewards loyalty program, which gives points to patients that go toward a redeemable gift card from over 25 merchandisers.\nAnd if my patient doesn\u2019t want the gift card?\nPatients also have the option to forgo that redeemable card and donate their rewards points to one of two vision-focused charitable organizations supported by B+L:\nOptometry Giving Sight\nTwo Blind Brothers\nAn online clothing shop in which customers shop \u201cblind\u201d to receive their purchases, with 100% of profits donated to support the Foundation Fighting Blindness\u2019s ongoing research.\nWhat else should I know?\nOpal is currently available to clinical practices with B+L products within the United States, including the District of Columbia (D.C.) and Mexico.\nNice! Lastly, where can I access this platform?\nContact the company for details on how to add this to your practice\u2019s offerings."

Based on reports, however, Innovent has eliminated its entire U.S. research team, with plans to close the facility in the near future.\nYikes! Good to know \u2026 now let\u2019s talk about IBI302.\nIBI302 is a high-dose, recombinant human vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR)-Fc-Human CR1 fusion protein injection.\nIts purpose: to improve vasopermeability and reduce leakage by blocking the VEGF-mediated signaling pathway, while also reducing the complement pathway-driven inflammatory response in wet AMD.\nHow does it do this?\nThe therapeutic contains two different proteins:\nN-terminus: this site binds to molecules within the VEGF family to block VEGF-controlled signaling and prevent vascular epithelium proliferation and angiogenesis.\nC-terminus: this site binds complement and can inhibit both the classic and alternative complement pathways to reduce the inflammatory response.\nClick here to learn about how these proteins work to treat wet AMD.\nNow talk about this study.\nThe multicenter, randomized, double-masked, active-controlled phase 2 clinical study (NCT05403749)\u2014one of two phase 2 studies conducted on wet AMD in a combined total of 360+ participants, according to Innovent\u2014enrolled 132 patients.\nThe purpose: to evaluate the longer interval of intravitreal injection of high-dose IBI302 over 52 weeks. \nThe setup: Participants were randomized 1:1:1 into three groups:\nIBI302 6.4 mg group\nIBI302 8.0 mg group\nAflibercept 2.0 mg group\nThe dose intervals:\nFollowing loading therapy, both IBI302 groups were dosed with adjusted intervals every 8 weeks or every 12 weeks, depending on patients\u2019 response to the loading therapy\nFollowing loading therapy, the aflibercept group was dosed every 8 weeks\nAnd the outcome measures?\nPer Clinical Trials, the primary endpoint was the change in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in the study eye, measured from baseline to week 40 (modified from week 52 in the original protocol).\nFor secondary endpoints, click here.\nWhat were the findings?\nOverall, the primary endpoint was successfully met, according to Innovent, with both IBI302 groups showing non-inferior BCVA gains compared to the aflibercept group.\nTalk numbers.\nAt week 40, the mean change (from baseline) in central subfield thickness (CST) was:\nIB302 6.4 mg group\n-163.19 \u03bcm\nIBI302 8.0 mg group\n-184.46 \u03bcm\nAflibercept 2.0 mg group\n-108.23 \u03bcm\nDid any participants extend their dosing intervals?\nYes! An estimated 81% and 88% of patients in the IBI302 6.4 mg and 8.0 mg groups did so, respectively,\nThis, Innovent reported, was similar to the 83% of subjects dosed every 12 weeks with aflibercept 8.0 mg (Eylea HD, Regeneron) in the PULSAR trial as well as 79.7% and 77.8% of subjects dosed every 12 weeks with faricimab-svoa (Vabysmo, Genentech) in the TENAYA and LUCERNE trials, respectively, by an indirect comparison.\nSo in a nutshell?\nInnovent reported a favorable overall safety profile consistent with previous studies on IBI302.\nSo what\u2019s next?\nAccording to Dr. Lei Qian, Innovent\u2019s vice president of Clinical Development, the company will continue to investigate the long-interval dosing efficacy and safety of IBI302 as a high dose in the phase 3 STAR trial, which was initiated in October 2023."

        "text": "GenSight Biologics releases 1-year data from phase 1/2 trial of RP treatment\nGenSight Biologics S.A. announced 4-year efficacy and safety results from the phase 3 REFLECT trial following post-treatment administration of LUMEVOQ (GS010; lenadogene nolparvovec) for Leber Hereditary Optic Neuropathy (LHON).\nStart with GenSight.\nFounded in 2012 and headquartered in Paris, France, Gensight Biologics is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on developing and commercializing gene therapies for neurodegenerative retinal diseases and central nervous system (CNS) disorders.\nAside from gene therapy, its therapeutic pipeline incorporates two core technologies:\nMitochondrial Targeting Sequence (MTS)\nDelivers nuclear messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) directly to the mitochondrial surface and imports newly-synthesized proteins into the mitochondrial matrix\nIntended result: restoration of mitochondrial function\nAlso: This is directly involved in the LUMEVOQ (GS010) process.\nOptogenetics\nTransfers gene codes for light-sensitive protein to enable neuronal cells\u2019 response to light stimulation\nThe target: to make retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) more sensitive to light\nAlso: This is directly involved in the GS030 therapeutic process for retinitis pigmentosa (see here for 1-year data).\nNow LUMEVOQ.\nPreviously referred to as GS010, Lumevoq is an adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector consisting of the ND4 gene (normally located in the mitochondria for synthesization).\nThe therapeutic payload is delivered via intravitreal injection into retinal cells to mitigate cellular damage\u2014using the MTS platform\u2014whereby it can be replaced and restored, thus potentially leading to vision improvement.\nWhat\u2019s its clinical status in the U.S.?\nLUMEVOQ received Orphan Drug Designation from the FDA in November 2013.\nGotcha. Now, talk about this REFLECT study.\nThe global, multicenter, randomized, double-masked phase 3 trial (NCT03293524) was designed under a special protocol assessment through the FDA.\nA total of 98 participants (aged 15+) were enrolled, all with vision loss due to LHON up to 1 year from onset.\nAnd these patients?\nEach participant received an intravitreal injection of Lumevoq into one affected eye; the second affected eye was randomized to receive either a second injection of LUMEVOQ (n = 48) or a placebo (n = 50) on the same day as the first eye or the day after.\nWhat was measured?\nThe original primary endpoint was best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) reported using LogMAR at 1 year post-treatment in the second affected eye.\nCurrent secondary endpoints included BCVA reported with LogMAR at 2 years post-treatment, measured at each timepoint of the follow-up period (1.5 years) and at 2 years. See here for the complete list, which included responder analysis.\nNow this 4-year data.\nFirst, the big picture: Following one injection of LUMEVOQ, visual acuity (VA) improvement remained sustained while also maintaining a favorable safety profile comparable in both bilaterally- and unilaterally-treated patients.\nEven further, the company reported that \u201cbilateral injection (of LUMEVOQ) provides an additional effect compared to unilateral treatment,\u201d with the difference being observed at 1.5 years post-treatment.\nThis was demonstrated across all analyses of VA improvement and responder rates.\nHow does this compare to last year\u2019s 3-year findings?\nGenSight stated that this latest data reinforces the previously-reported data. See here for those findings, which Glance covered last March.\nWhat was the average VA increase?\nAmong LUMEVOQ-treated eyes\u2014and compared to nadir\u2014average VA increase was beyond the +15 letter threshold used to define clinically meaningful improvement, according to GenSight.\nNote: Nadir refers to the worst BCVA recorded from baseline to Year 4.\nGive me some more numbers.\nFollowing bilateral injection, GenSight reported that:\n73% of patient experienced a clinically meaningful improvement of at least -0.3 LogMAR (+15 ETDRS letters) relative to their observed nadir\n81% of bilaterally-treated patients demonstrated on-chart vision (reading letters on a screen)\nGo on \u2026\nThe company noted that the likelihood of treated patients achieving on-chart vision is \u201ctwice as high with bilateral treatment versus a unilateral injection (odds ratio: 2.0 [0.7;5.5]).\u201d\nAny adverse reactions?\nWhile there were no serious ocular adverse events (AEs), the most commonly encountered ocular AE was mild intraocular inflammation that was responsive to conventional treatment.\nThis was consistent with 3-year data.\nSo what\u2019s next?\nParticipants of the REFLECT study will continue to be monitored for a 5-year post-injection follow-up period."

These consistent results are bolstered by our OPTIC long-term data where we have demonstrated stable therapeutic aflibercept levels through 5 years. The data across both studies support a reliable long-term benefit and a predictable safety profile.\"\nThe data also showed that Ixo-vec maintained therapeutic aflibercept levels for up to 5 years, suggesting a durable effect that could reduce or eliminate the need for regular anti-VEGF injections. This is especially promising given that, in real-world scenarios, nearly 57% of wet AMD patients stop anti-VEGF treatment within 5 years, often resulting in significant vision loss, according to Adverum. \nLUNA Phase 2 Trial: Key Findings at 52 Weeks\nThe LUNA study, a randomized, double-masked trial involving 60 patients, evaluated two dose levels (6E10 and 2E11 vg/eye) and various prophylactic regimens to prevent inflammation. At the 52-week mark, both doses of Ixo-vec demonstrated:\nMaintenance of Best Corrected Visual Acuity (BCVA) with a mean change close to baseline\nSignificant reductions in Central Subfield Thickness (CST), a key measure of retinal fluid levels\n88% (6E10) and 92% (2E11) reduction in anti-VEGF treatment burden\nOver half of the patients were injection-free at 1 year, with 75% requiring only one injection or fewer in the higher dose cohort\n\u201cToday\u2019s LUNA 52-week data support our decision to advance the 6E10 dose and topical-eyedrops-only prophylaxis into phase 3,\" Rabia Gurses Ozden, MD, Chief Medical Officer at Adverum, said in the news release. \"One of the unique, and in my view, profound aspects of this LUNA update was the near unanimous patient preference for Ixo-vec, as assessed via a pre-specified patient survey. The vast majority preferred Ixo-vec over their prior intravitreal injections. No patients on topical eyedrops alone stated that the steroid eyedrops were difficult to manage. And 100% of patients who received Ixo-vec 6E10 and eyedrops alone preferred Ixo-vec over prior anti-VEGF treatments.\u201d\nPatient preference surveys revealed strong support for Ixo-vec: 93% of patients preferred it over prior anti-VEGF therapies, with 100% of those on the 6E10 dose opting to receive treatment in both eyes if necessary, according to Adverum.\nOPTIC Phase 1/2 Study: Durable 4-Year Outcomes\nThe OPTIC study, which enrolled patients with severe wet AMD requiring frequent anti-VEGF injections, showed impressive long-term efficacy over 4 years:\nAn 86% reduction in annual anti-VEGF injections at year 4\nNearly half of the participants remained injection-free for the entire follow-up period\nStable aflibercept levels detected up to five years post-treatment, supporting the durability of Ixo-vec's gene therapy approach\nPivotal Program and Future Plans\nAdverum is preparing to initiate its phase 3 ARTEMIS trial in the first half of 2025, designed to establish Ixo-vec as a standard of care for wet AMD. The pivotal trial will involve 284 patients in the US, with the primary goal of demonstrating noninferiority to standard anti-VEGF treatments in terms of BCVA.\nThe ARTEMIS study will use a double-masked, randomized design, incorporating both treatment-na\u00efve and experienced wet AMD patients."

        "text": "FDA Clears Novoxel's Tixel for the Treatment of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction\nResearchers funded by the National Eye Institute (NEI) have successfully used a gene-editing technique to correct a mutation responsible for retinitis pigmentosa (RP). The study, led by Krzysztof Palczewski, PhD, of the University of California, Irvine, was published on November 18 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nThe team employed a CRISPR-Cas9-based tool called base editing to precisely target and correct a rhodopsin-150K mutation in a mouse model of RP. This mutation, which affects the rhodopsin protein critical for vision, leads to the structural and functional failure of rod photoreceptors.\nIn the treated mice, up to 44% of the rhodopsin gene product was successfully edited, resulting in restored rhodopsin production. Electroretinography tests revealed modest improvements in retinal function in mice treated within 15 days of birth. However, mice treated later in life, after significant retinal degeneration had occurred, showed limited improvement.\n\u201cThis approach shows promise for treating inherited retinal diseases caused by rhodopsin mutations, which currently have no available treatments,\u201d Dr. Palczewski, who collaborated with David R. Liu, PhD, of the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, stated in an NIH news release.\nThe researchers also observed that the gene-editing treatment prevented the loss of the retina's outer nuclear layer, which houses the nuclei of rod and cone photoreceptors. This preservation is critical, as rod photoreceptors support the health of cone photoreceptors, which are responsible for color vision and daytime sight.\nThe study suggests that further optimization of the dosing regimen and surgical technique could enhance treatment outcomes. The researchers noted that the findings pave the way for potential clinical applications, with the hope that correcting even a subset of rod photoreceptors might halt retinal degeneration and improve vision in patients.\nThis research was supported by NEI. For more details, the full study can be accessed at PNAS."

        "text": "SpyGlass Pharma Unveils Promising 18-Month Data from First-in-Human Study of Glaucoma Drug Delivery Platform\n10.18.2024\nAAO: Home OCT Device Improves Care for AMD Patients, Reduces Costs and Burden\nA newly approved home-based OCT device developed by Notel Vision is allowing patients to monitor their own eye health between appointments, providing physicians with crucial data without requiring in-office visits, according to an AAO news release. A study presented today at AAO 2024 suggests that daily self-imaging using this home OCT device could significantly improve care for patients with wet AMD. Additionally, the study shows that it could reduce both the financial and logistical burdens on patients and the healthcare system.\nThe study included 15 retina specialists who reviewed treatment decisions for 37 eyes of patients with wet AMD. Initially, these decisions were based solely on in-office OCT scans, which occur at regular intervals. However, when the physicians were given the patients' home OCT scan data, they were asked to reassess their original treatment decisions.\nThe results were striking:\nIn 42% of cases, physicians concluded that treatment could have been delayed based on the home OCT data\nIn 35% of cases, they recommended treatment should have been administered at least a week earlier than it was\nIn only 23% of cases did physicians agree with the original timing of the treatment, within a margin of one week\n\"While I expected home OCT data to have some influence on decision-making, the magnitude of the impact was a surprise,\" Paul Hahn, MD, PhD, a retina specialist and the lead researcher, said in the news release. \"But once we consider that physicians now have 30 times more data than before, allowing them to 'fill in the blanks' between visits, it makes sense.\"\nThe study revealed that using home OCT devices could lead to significant cost savings. Dr. Hahn\u2019s statistical model estimated a 28% reduction in drug costs due to fewer unnecessary treatments, as well as reduced office visits, leading to savings on in-office procedures and loss of patient productivity. Each office visit represents an estimated loss of $159 for procedures and $117 in patient productivity, according to the study.\nCurrent treatment models for wet AMD typically schedule injections in advance of possible disease reactivation because there has been no way to monitor disease progression between visits. With the availability of home OCT devices, however, physicians can now have a continuous stream of data to help make more informed decisions.\n\"The presence of home OCT data provides a much-needed safety net,\" said Dr. Hahn. \"This not only limits unnecessary treatments but also provides a mechanism to treat patients promptly when needed, improving overall care.\"\nThe home OCT device, developed by Notal Vision, allows patients to perform a self-operated scan in less than one minute per eye. The images are automatically transmitted via a wireless connection to the Notal Health Cloud for analysis. A proprietary AI-based software, the Notal OCT Analyzer, interprets the images and segments the volume of hypo-reflective spaces on the scans, providing key insights into retinal fluid accumulation.\nPhysicians can review the data through a HIPAA-compliant web portal, set eye-specific notification criteria such as fluid volume thresholds, and receive alerts when certain thresholds are crossed.\nNotal Vision has worked to ensure that physicians can be reimbursed for remote OCT monitoring. Three new CPT codes\u20140604T, 0605T, and 0606T\u2014allow physicians and the monitoring center to bill for services every 30 days. Notal is also collaborating with Medicare Administrative Contractors to establish full coverage and payment for remote OCT services."

        "text": "New data on Eylea HD supports prolonged dosing for wet AMD\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) has filed a lawsuit against Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. alleging the company has been intentionally overcharging Medicare for its Eylea (aflibercept) injection 2 mg.\nLots to unpack here\u2026 let\u2019s start with Eylea.\nDeveloped by Regeneron and Bayer AG, Eylea is a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor administered as an intravitreal injection.\nEylea was most recently approved by the FDA in February 2023 for retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) treatment in preterm infants; prior to that, it was approved for the following retinal diseases:\nWet age-related macular degeneration (AMD)\nMacular edema following retinal vein occlusion (RVO)\nDiabetic macular edema (DME)\nDiabetic retinopathy (DR)\nGo on\u2026\nEylea is what\u2019s known as a \u201cbuy-and-bill\u201d drug, as the DOJ noted, in which clinicians and their practices (Regeneron\u2019s customers) typically \u201cincur an upfront expense to purchase Eylea that payors later reimburse.\u201d \nIn most cases, these customers (retinal and other ophthalmic practices) purchase the drug from third-party distributors.\nAnd who are Eylea\u2019s distributors?\nRegeneron is reported to have established distribution contracts with the following:\nBesse Medical\nMcKesson Corporation\nCuraScript SD Specialty Distribution\nMetro Medical (division of Cardinal Health)\nNow explain the Medicare process for Eylea.\nAs the lawsuit outlines, once a clinician administers the drug to a patient, that practice submits a claim for reimbursement to Medicare or other payors.\nWith Medicare Part B, Eylea (and other similarity-administered drugs) is intended to be reimbursed based on what\u2019s known as an average sales price (ASP) of the drug.\nExplain ASP.\nASPs are calculated by dividing a manufacturer\u2019s total revenue from drugs sold to U.S. purchasers by the total number of units sold in a given calendar year.\nA drug\u2019s ASP is based on the average prices for sales of that drug within the U.S. (minus price concessions, ie: a price that is lower than the originally-agreed-upon price).\nWith Medicare, providers are reimbursed at a rate of the ASP plus an additional 6% fee. These ASPs are then used to establish reimbursement rates for such drugs as Eylea.\nWhat\u2019s a company\u2019s legal obligation with ASPs?\nAs mandated by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), drug manufacturers\u2014such as Regeneron\u2014are required to report the ASP of each of their Medicare Part B drugs on a quarterly basis.\nAlrighty, now let\u2019s dive into these new allegations.\nFiled in the U.S. District Court in Massachusetts under the False Claims Act (FCA), the lawsuit alleges that the company \u201cfraudulently manipulated Medicare reimbursement\u201d for Eylea by \u201cknowingly submitting false (ASP) reports to Medicare.\u201d\nNote: The FCA is a federal law that imposes liability on any person(s) or companies who defraud governmental programs.\nGotcha. What else is the company accused of?\nPer the complaint, Regeneron reportedly inflated the ASP for Eylea by \u201cpaying credit card processing fees for the benefit of physician-customers purchasing Eylea.\u201d\nThe mistake: The company failed to report those payments as price concessions to Eylea\u2019s ASP.\nThe (alleged) consequence of this: Due to this, false claims for Eylea were submitted, along with \u201chundreds of millions of dollars\u201d in inflated reimbursements by Medicare.\nSee page 45 of the lawsuit for examples of these claims, made from March 2013 to March 2023.\nWas Regeneron aware of its wrongdoing?\nApparently so.\nThat includes knowing it was required to report all price concessions for Eylea\u2014yet still choosing not to include those concessions (in the form of credit card processing fees).\nPer the DOJ, these concessions were meant to be paid to specialty drug distributors for the benefit of its customers.\nWho ended up paying those fees?\nRegeneron, the lawsuit alleges. \nThe company reportedly paid the fees for Eylea purchases so that \u201cdistributors would accept credit cards for physicians\u2019 Eylea purchases while still charging those customers the lower cash price.\u201d\nAnd what benefit did this give to the company\u2019s customers?\nThanks to those payments, Regeneron\u2019s customers were allegedly able to use credit cards to purchase Eylea without an additional fee.\nIn addition, these distributions received benefits such as \u201ccash back\u201d and other credit card benefits, the lawsuit alleges.\nIn fact, the DOJ further alleged that the company \u201cinternally attempted to disguise the payments as \u2018bona fide service fees\u2019 (BFSFs), which are not considered price concessions, when it knew the payments were not BFSFs.\u201d\nYikes. What exactly prompted this investigation?\nA whistleblower. Plus, two former Regeneron employees are named in the lawsuit as \u201crealtors\u201d (private parties) who filed the FCA allegations.\nQuick refresh: Under the FCA, a private party can file a lawsuit on behalf of the government (under \u201cqui tam\u201d suits) against those who have allegedly defrauded the government.\nIn this case, the FCA enabled the U.S. government (the DOJ) to take action against Regeneron.\nSo... what happens if Regeneron is found liable?\nIf the company is found in violation of the FCA, the government is permitted to \u201crecover three times the amount of its losses plus applicable penalties,\u201d the DOJ stated.\nLastly, has the company commented on these allegations yet?\nIn a statement to Glance, Regeneron said that the complaint relates to its \"lawful reimbursement of costs incurred by our specialty distributors\" and that the allegations are \u201cwithout merit.\"\nThe company further claims it \u201chas fully cooperated with the government\u2019s investigation and will vigorously defend itself in court.\u201d\nEditor's note: This story was updated on April 13, 2024, to include Regeneron's response to our request for comment. \n*Disclaimer: The information provided in this article does not and is not intended to constitute legal advice; instead, all information, content, materials available herein are for general information purposes only."

Those violations were also related to the June 2023 inspection (notably not previous inspections conducted in 2015, 2017, and 2020).\nAlso take note: Though all four inspections were conducted at the Palm Harbor, Florida-located plant, those previous inspections were actually tissue processing inspections\u2014not drug manufacturing inspections, as was the case of the June 2023 inspection.\nThose details: The agency posted a summary of its findings\u2014which ultimately led to the worst overall outcome rating of \u201cOfficial Action Indicated (OAI)\u201d\u2014that included 15 regulatory violations.\nAnd how did the company respond to these?\nAn RPP representative told Glance in December 2023 that, following the June 2023 inspection: \u201cRPP spent the next 4 months completing the actions necessary to address the observations,\u201d and, to date, had addressed all of the agency\u2019s observations.\nIf that\u2019s the case, then why a new warning letter?\nThat\u2019s what we wondered as well (side note: see this rundown on what exactly a warning letter is).\nSo here\u2019s what we know: On Aug. 16, the agency sent a warning letter addressed to Carl R. Harrell, MD, owner, chairman, CEO, and medical director of RPP, in regards to that 10-day June 2023 inspection.\nThe products of interest in this letter:\nRegener-Eyes Professional (PRO) Ophthalmic Solution\nRegener-Eyes LITE Ophthalmic Solution\nRegener-Eyes ophthalmic drug product containing amniotic fluid\nWhat issues were found with these products?\nThe letter stated that both Regener-Eyes PRO and LITE products are in violation of the Federal Food Drug & Cosmetic (FD&C) Act by being \u201cunapproved new drugs introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce (which is prohibited).\u201d\nPlus: Both products were also noted as being misbranded (false or misleading) under the FD&C Act.\nWe\u2019ll explain below.\nLet\u2019s go into details on those violations.\nBased on the product labeling for Regener-Eyes PRO and LITE\u2014which indicate they \u201crelieve dryness of the eye,\u201d among other claims\u2014the products are marketed as being intended for use as \u201cophthalmic demulcent (lubricant) drug products,\u201d the agency stated.\nThe problem with this: The FDA determined that these products are actually \u201cunapproved new drugs\u201d and their marketing is in violation of two sections within the FD&C Act.\nNote: The term \u201cnew drug\u201d applies to a product that is \u201cnot generally recognized as safe and effective (GRASE) for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended, or suggested in its labeling\u201d\u2014with a few exceptions, which the agency noted were not applicable in this case.\nWith this in mind: A supposed new drug is not permitted to be introduced or delivered for introduction into interstate commerce without an approved FDA application.\nAnd in the case of these products?\nAccording to the agency, there\u2019s currently no FDA-approved applications for either of these Regener-Eyes products.\nYikes. Go on \u2026\nThe FDA further wrote that certain nonprescription drugs marketed without an FDA approved application (referred to as \u201cover-the-counter [OTC] monograph drugs\u201d) are able to be legally marketed if they meet certain monograph requirements.\nIn this case: Per the agency, the Regener-Eyes products failed to meet monograph conditions and be deemed GRASE due to the use of unpermitted active ingredients, inaccurate portrayal of active vs inactive ingredients; and the exclusion of certain required labeling statements.\nAs such: Regener-Eyes PRO and LITE were determined to be unapproved new drugs.\nTime out on this for a moment. Didn't Regener-Eyes file an OTC Monograph Final?\nYes, but that was for Regener-Eyes\u2019s flagship product: Regener-Eyes Ophthalmic Solution.\nThe details: The company previously noted to Glance that the FDA approved an OTC Monograph Final back in August 2022 for that solution.\nRegener-Eyes filed an OTC Monograph Final with the indication to relieve dryness of the eye for the Regener-Eyes Ophthalmic Solution.\nEven further: The OTC Monograph was reportedly the subject of a final administrative order by the FDA\u2014meaning that the non-prescription drug is \u201cgenerally (GRASE) for its intended use.\"\nTo note: Both Regener-Eyes PRO and LITE products include, among other ingredients, the flagship product formulation.\nInteresting \u2026 are those all the violations?\nUnfortunately, no. The letter also called out the Regener-Eyes PRO and LITE products as being misbranded under the FD&C Act due to their labeling because \u201cfalse or misleading for several reasons.\u201d\nIncluded among those reasons:\nIncorrectly identifying an inactive ingredient (tonicity solution sodium chloride)\nRepresenting the products as being \u201cin full compliance with the FDA\u201d\nInaccurately portraying OTC drug registration or listing as akin to prescription drug approval\nMisbranding products (due to their nonprescription nature)\nGo on ..\nThere were also eight cGMP violations noted, viewable here.\nA few of those included failure to:\nEstablish / follow appropriate written procedures for preventing microbiological contamination of drug products\nImplement an adequate system for monitoring environmental conditions in order to prevent contamination or mixups\nConduct at least one test to verify the identity of each component within a drug product\nSo these were all based on the June 2023 inspection, correct?\nIndeed they were.\nAnd it\u2019s important to know: The agency noted that the company had responded to its initial Form 483 following that inspection on six separate occasions between July 2023 and February 2024.\nSee our December 2023 coverage on that, which included 15 regulatory violations.\nDid the company correct those violations?\nThe FDA acknowledged four specific actions the company took to address the violations within those six correspondences. Among those noted were:\nVoluntarily suspending manufacturing operations/distribution of any Regener-Eyes products filled post-inspection until after completing the corrective actions\nHiring a qualified consultant to assist in meeting cGMP requirements and resuming drug manufacturing operations for the U.S. market\nHowever: Some of those corrective actions \u201care not adequate to address the above-referenced violations,\u201d the agency wrote.\nWait, why not?\nPer the agency, this was \u201cbecause they lack supporting documentation\u201d and that Regener-Eyes\u2019 responses \u201cdo not address [their] specific plans for disposition of the inventory of your ophthalmic products at your facility.\u201d\nFurther: In reference to the company\u2019s \u201cpreviously distributed product,\u201d the FDA said Regener-Eyes didn\u2019t elaborate on the specific actions they took\u2014or plan to take\u2014in order to address those aforementioned violations on its distributed Regener-Eyes PRO and LITE products.\nNote: These products, the agency emphasized, were manufactured under its violation-targeted conditions and labeled with a 2-year shelf life.\nSix instances of additional inadequacies were also mentioned.\nThat\u2019s quite a few issues \u2026 any other concerns?\nYou had to ask\u2014and yes: three major areas:\nContamination risks\nProducts potentially containing amniotic fluid\nRecords\nBreak them down for me.\nWe\u2019ll start with contamination.\nThe FDA wrote that the Regener-Eyes PRO and LITE products:\nAre packed in multi-dose vials that do not have a mechanism for backup flow prevention and are preservative-free (see below for why this is an issue)\nDo not contain a substance that prevents organism growth\nContainer type didn\u2019t provide adequate protection or minimize the hazard of injury (ie: a condition or circumstance that could lead to injury, illness, or property damage) from contamination during use\nAnd the concern?\nAccording to the agency: Multi-dose ophthalmic drug products should have at least one suitable substance that preserves a product and \u201cminimize the hazard of injury resulting from incidental contamination during use.\u201d\nEven further: The FDA stipulated that any ophthalmic drug product lacking \u201cadequate preservative properties\u201d when exposed to this in-use contamination is particularly vulnerable to a rapid increase in microbes\u2014which \u201ccan pose severe harm to consumers.\u201d\nAnd given the topical administration of Regener-Eyes products into the eyes, the company\u2019s \u201csignificant cGMP violations\u201d pose a \u201cheightened risk of harm to users,\u201d as the products bypass some of the body\u2019s natural defenses.\nNow this potential amniotic fluid.\nThe FDA stated that a October 2022 letter issued to Regener-Eyes, LLC notified the subsidiary that its flagship product (Regener-Eyes Ophthalmic Solution) appeared to be a drug and biological product that\u2014in order to be lawfully marketed\u2014required a valid biologics license.\nDuring the June 2023 inspection: The agency noted that the company claimed it had discontinued manufacturing of that amniotic fluid-containing solution in June 2021 (approximately).\nAdditionally: The company also reportedly stated that any remaining amniotic fluid at its facility was only used for research purposes.\nAnd the issue with this?\nDespite the company\u2019s insistence, the FDA reported, investigators had documented that Regener-Eyes was continuing to receive shipments of amniotic fluids.\nEven more: These were matched with \u201cRPP inventory and Regener-Eyes PRO and Regener-Eyes LITE manufacturing batch records for products manufactured after June 2021.\u201d\nThe agency added that this finding plus its previously-stated violations\u2014including failing to test sodium chloride for identity and to document the use of sodium chloride in its batch records\u2014led it to question if the company\u2019s products (manufactured post-June 2021) may actually still contain amniotic fluid.\nWhy the cause for concern with amniotic fluid eye drops?\nLet\u2019s talk about them: Amniotic fluid eye drops are regulated as drugs or biological products under the FDA\u2019s protocols.\nIn order to be FDA-approved for testing, mitigating, or curing disease, the drops need to have an investigational new drug application (IND)\nTo be marketed, they would require a Biologics License Application (BLA).\nAnd according to the FDA?\nThere are currently no amniotic fluid eye drops that have been approved for testing, mitigating, or curing diseases, the agency reported.\nSee here for details on Regener-Eyes\u2019 previous run-in with the agency (and its response) following a public safety notification issued in April 2023.\nGotcha. And along those lines \u2026\nAlso of significant concern for the agency was that its investigators were \u201cunable to obtain records pertaining to the manufacture and distribution of [their] Regener-Eyes ophthalmic solution product containing amniotic fluid\u201d that was requested during their inspection.\nTell me that\u2019s the last of these violations.\nUnfortunately, no. Two other areas the FDA called out were:\nIn-use stability studies\nNotably, the agency stated that \u201cstability studies are needed to support\u201d the company\u2019s website claim indiating Regener-Eyes PRO and LITE products can be stored at room temperature and used within 90 days after opening.\nGlycerin-containing products\nThe company\u2019s glycerin-containing products require a limit test in the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) to ensure they meet the relevant safety limits.\nThat\u2019s \u2026 a lot. Has the company responded to this yet?\nIndeed it has. In response to Glance\u2019s request for comment, the Regener-Eyes Corporate Team stated:\n\u201cIt's important to note that this warning letter references an inspection conducted 15 months ago, June 2023, with some additional concerns regarding Regener-Eyes marketing claims and further updated concerns for RPP manufacturing.\u201d\nThe team further noted that they have already engaged with the FDA to address these concerns, including already \u201celiminating the misbranding concerns\u201d the agency noted as well as revising \u201cour marketing practices and claims to align with OTC Monograph Drug standards.\u201d\nAnd in terms of those cGMP violations?\nThe Regener-Eyes team said its commitment to adhering to cGMP standards is \u201cunwavering,\u201d and that they \u201cprioritize both patient safety and regulatory compliance.\u201d\nThat being said \u2026\n\u201cOur manufacturer (RPP) has already answered the FDA and has, since the audit in 2023, proactively implemented substantial improvements to strengthen our processes and enhance our procedures in response to FDA feedback concerning common Good Manufacturing Practices (cGMP),\u201d the team told Glance.\nThey emphasized: \u201cThere have been no contaminations and no recalls of the Regener-Eyes products.\u201d\nAnd further noted: \u201cRPP has also addressed concerns about Regener-Eyes product ingredients to ensure complete alignment with OTC Monograph Drug standards.\u201d\nDid they provide any specific update to their practices?\nJust one: The team stated that they\u2019re now using \u201cnew preservative free bottles\u201d for their Regener-Eyes products, \u201cwhich we believe will further enhance the safety and trust in the product.\u201d\n*Disclaimer: The information provided in this article does not and is not intended to constitute legal advice; instead, all information, content, materials available herein are for general information purposes only.\nEditor's note: This article was updated on Sept. 17, 2024, to include the term \"backup flow prevention\" under the \"Break it down for me\" section as well as to clarify verbiage in a header indicating Regener-Eyes \"filed\" for an OTC Monograph Final instead of being \"approved for\" an OTC Monograph Final."

Acker, Sc.D., and Chief Operating Officer Patrick Lopath, the TECLens\u2019 MAB comprises five notable eyecare professionals:\nRoy S. Chuck, MD, PhD\nEric D. Donnenfeld, MD\nDeborah S. Jacobs, MD\nPaul Karpecki, OD\nPeter J. McDonnell, MD\nAlrighty, now let\u2019s talk tech.\nThe company\u2019s proprietary technology is dubbed the Quantitative Corneal Cross-linking (qCXL), developed with the intent to reshape the cornea for the following corrections:\nReading distance vision among presbyopes\nProgressive pediatric myopia control\nAdult refractive errors (ie: hyperopia, low-order myopia)\nExplain how it works.\nThe qCXL technology consists of a device (CXLens) that is applied directly to the eye\u2019s scleral surface following a topical administration of riboflavin (Vitamin B2) ophthalmic solution.\nWhat it does: The device releases patterned ultraviolet (UV) light to \u201ccrosslink\u201d (illuminate) specific, selected zones of the cornea.\nThis illumination continues until an on-board sensor and algorithms deem that \u201ccertain biomechanical properties of the corneal stroma have been adjusted to pre-planned values,\u201d according to TECLens.\nWhat biomechanical properties are measured?\nThese real-time parameters include:\nIncrease in corneal stiffness\nCollagen fiber tightening\nCorneal thickness changes\nGotcha. And this enables\u2026?\nSuch \u201cclosed-loop dosing\u201d results in precise control over corneal shape\u2014with the capability to \u201cpredictably improve a patient\u2019s vision.\u201d\nRefresh: Closed-loop dosing involves selective stiffening of the corneal surface\nAnd what other features does it include?\nThe scleral lens platform also provides:\nIntegrated real-time ultrasound elastography\nProprietary riboflavin-driver tech for intact corneal epithelium procedures\nPossibility for bilateral treatment\nClick here for a visual of the procedure.\nSo how long does the entire process take?\nThe treatment is estimated to take less than 30 minutes.\nHow are patients taken into consideration during the procedure?\nThe company noted that, as a non-invasive, transepithelial approach, the CXLens scleral design was developed to be both comfortable for the patient and stable on the eye.\nIn fact: Patients can be treated with either their eyes opened or closed, sitting upright in a chair or lying down.\nNote: No lid speculum is required.\nWhy should clinicians consider this for their practice?\nThe company has noted that the qCXL offers a \u201ctechnologically-advanced (CXL) platform\u201d without needing to skimp on operational simplicity (it has a small clinical footprint) or affordability.\nAlong the lines of affordability, it\u2019s also reported to be designed as an \u201cinexpensive\u201d control system that offers an easy market entry access for clinicians to both qCXL and refractive correction.\nAs a bonus: The system can simultaneously treat multiple eyes and patients\u2014with no assistant required.\nAnd what\u2019s the overall significance of this?\nThis technology could potentially offer relief for a wider range of patients\u2014including those who may not be the best candidates for other refractive procedures, or those interested in alternative treatments to standard refractive surgeries.\nPlus, Johnson & Johnson noted that the treatment may even (in the future) support cataract patients who are candidates for presbyopia-correcting intraocular lenses (PC-IOLs).\nThis sounds promising\u2026 has the system undergone any clinical research yet?\nYes, in fact. TECLens noted it successfully conducted a pilot study that evaluated the system\u2019s capabilities for providing qCXL treatment in nine corneal transplant candidates with advanced keratoconus.\nWhat was measured: Maximum keratometry, thinnest corneal thickness, and endothelial cell density between screening and 6 months after qCXL.\nPlus: Differences in best-corrected visual acuity (BCA) between screening and 6 months post-qCXL\nAnd the findings?\nPublished in Translational Vision Science & Technology in April 2021, the results included:At 6 months after the novel CXL procedure, the treatment eyes had:\nAverage \u22121.0 \u00b1 1.6 diopters decrease in the maximum keratometry (P = 0.049)\nNonsignificant 2.3 \u00b1 7.5 letter improvement in BCVA (P = 0.19)\nNonsignificant \u221217 \u00b1 14 \u00b5m decrease in thinnest corneal thickness (P < 0.01)\nNonsignificant \u221286 \u00b1 266 cells/mm2 decrease in endothelial cell density (P = 0.20)\nThe study authors concluded that the CXLens demonstrated feasibility in its treatment for keratoconus and was deemed ready for large-scale studies with longer follow-up periods.\nWith that in mind, any upcoming studies to know about?\nYes! TECLens reported it is currently in the planning stages of its first refractive-correction clinical studies for the CXLens device. So you know what that means\u2026\nStay tuned!"

        "text": "OCT-A determines DME treatment response to alternative therapies\nIn a recent study published in the American Journal of Ophthalmology, researchers assessed the effect of blue-light filtering (BLF) intraocular lenses (IOLs) on the development and progression of macular atrophy (MA) in eyes with neurovascular age-related macular degeneration (nAMD).\nGive me some background first.\nLet's talk AMD: AMD is the leading cause of irreversible blindness in older adults aged 65+. The disease causes damage to the macula and can blur the central vision.\nNow BLF IOLs: These IOLs filter short-wave light and selectively reduce the transmission of ultraviolet (UV) radiation.\nNow, talk about the study.\nResearchers conducted a retrospective registry-based cohort study of consecutive cataract surgeries performed between September 2007 and September 2018 at the Ophthalmology Unit of Kymenlaakso Central Hospital in Kotka, Finland.\nThe inclusion criteria to study a nAMD cohort was the availability of consecutive optical coherence tomography (OCT) follow-ups of every participant in the study.\nNote: The investigators noted that follow-ups of each patient were not retrospectively applicable for non-nAMD participants.\nWho were the participants?\nThe study included 373 patients (373 eyes) with concomitant nAMD who received intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injections and underwent uneventful cataract surgery.\nAmong the participants, 206 eyes were implanted with BLF IOLs and 167 eyes were implanted with standard IOLs.\nPatient demographics were:\nAged 50+\nMean age 78.6\u00b16.7 at surgery\n67.4% female\nHow was the study designed?\nThe investigators conducted the following:\nCompared subsequent MA rates between the BLF IOL and non-BLF IOL participants\nManually reviewed OCT scans in a masked manner to examine patient baseline variables and IOL status\nAssessed a patient\u2019s overall risk of developing new-onset MA and the effect of the IOL type on disease progression\nTechnology update: Heidelberg Engineering software was used to manually evaluate and calculate the MA area. \nStudy duration: Patients were followed until June 2023; death was considered a censoring event.\nFindings?\nThe researchers found that both groups had comparable baseline parameters including:\nAge\nSex\nCorrected distance visual acuity (VA)\nMacular thickness\nCumulative number of anti-VEGF injections\nComparable follow-up times\n3164\u00b11420 days vs. 3180\u00b11403 days, respectively, P=0.908\nHow many MA cases were detected?\nIt was discovered that:\nNine pre-existing and 77 new-onset MA cases were detected\nSimilar distribution between BLF (P=0.598) and non-BLF eyes (P=0.399)\nWhen adjusted for age and sex, the Univariate Kaplan Meier (P=0.366) and multivariate Cox regression analysis showed:\nBLF-IOLs were comparable to non-BLF IOLs in relation to risk for new-onset MA\n(HR 1.236, 95% CI 0.784-1.949, P=0.363)\nWhat about the data for MA?\nFinal MA area at the last visit was:\n5.14\u00b14.71mm2 for BLF IOLs (P=0.028)\n8.56\u00b19.17mm2 for non-BLF IOLs (P=0.028)\nThe mean annual MA area increase was:\n78\u00b10.84mm2 (P=0.042)\n1.26\u00b11.32mm2 (P=0.042)\nLimitations?\nThe authors noted that the study was retrospective in design.\nWhy this matters: Residual confounding such as smoking, sunlight exposure, and genetic predisposition may have been present and were not accounted for.\nFurther, allocation to IOL type was at the surgeon\u2019s discretion and not randomized; plus, the authors stated that they did not use fully automated image detection software. \nA full overview of the limitations can be found here.\nExpert opinion?\nThe investigators recommended that further research be conducted to observe if these findings can be generalized for a non-wet AMD cohort.\nTake home.\nThe results of this study show that, while there is no added benefit of BLF IOLs to non-BLF IOLs regarding MA-free survival, BLF IOLs were associated with less MA progression over time.\nThe authors stated this may suggest that, \u201cfiltering the shorter wavelengths of light using BLF-IOLs could provide protection against MA progression.\u201d"

Moving on to this physician-patient focus \u2026\nStrengthening the doctor-patient relationship\u2014through legislative efforts and collaborations\u2014is a key component of JJV\u2019s strategic partnerships with AOA, according to Tierney.\nHow they\u2019re doing this: Largely through advocacy, community, and DEI initiatives.\nCase in point: In honor of Juneteenth (June 19), the company partnered with Black Eyecare Perspective (BEP), an OD-founded organization focused on redefining the color of the industry by creating a pipeline for African-American/Black students into the optometric field.\nTheir collaboration: JJV and BEP hosted the \u201cAllyship as a Leadership Skill Network\u201d session exploring measures designed to address the current disparities in optometry and how to create a more representative and inclusive optometric profession.\n\u201cWe want to ensure that this eyecare space truly reflects the diversity of the community,\u201d Tierney said. \u201cAnd that means doctors, extenders, and all patients in need of eye care support and health over their lifetime.\u201d\nAnd on the education front?\nTierney noted JJV\u2019s support efforts for optometry students and new optometrists\u2014a unique segment of the optometric population.\nAt AOA: The American Optometric Student Association (AOSA) Journey Through Optometry event is intended to provide students with guidance on navigating their optometric careers.\nAny specific programs JJV is involved in?\nYes! Included among these efforts is its role as a joint partner (with AOA) of the InfantSEE program, a national public health program managed by Optometry Cares \u2014 The AOA Foundation.\nLaunched in 2005, InfantSEE provides no-cost, comprehensive eye and vision health assessments for infants (aged 6-12 months), regardless of family income or insurance coverage.\nAt AOA: On the show floor, JJV will be continuing its 19-year co-hosting role for the program.\nNow, talk about the ongoing initiative mentioned earlier.\nOriginally launched in September 2023, JJV\u2019s \u201cVision Made Possible\u201d global effort is targeted toward spreading awareness of eye health\u2014including presbyopia, cataracts, and pediatric myopia (a hot topic featured at this year\u2019s Optometry\u2019s Meeting).\nThe inspiration: The company\u2019s vision of \u201chealthy sight for life,\u201d according to Tierney.\n\u201cWe\u2019re looking to reimagine and deliver the most all-encompassing eye care to meet the healthcare needs of a patient journey\u2014from as early on as infant and childhood myopia management through to the mature and aging eye,\u201d she said.\nMore specifically: \u201cThis theme is something our whole organization got around that\u2019s not just based on technology and innovation, but more on human connection,\u201d Tierney noted.\nHow has the company captured this?\nJJV collaborated with a New York Times best-selling author/photographer/director to visually and narratively share stories from patients and eye care professionals (ECPs) across the globe who were diagnosed and treated with a wide range of ocular diseases\u2014including myopia, a rapidly growing disease among pediatric patients.\nKey to these stories: Highlighting how these patients\u2019 and ECPs\u2019 lives improved following their receiving proper vision care as well as educating readers on the critical need for comprehensive eye care.\nRead and watch their journeys here.\nThis sounds like a great initiative \u2026 how can I learn more and get involved?\nIf you\u2019re attending Optometry\u2019s Meeting, stop by the JJV booth (#903) in the Exhibit Hall to speak with a representative.\nIf not, contact the company directly or reach out to Charissa Lee, OD, MBA, FAAO, head of North America Professional Affairs to learn more."

If you continue to have this issue please contact customerservice@slackinc.com.\nOver the course of the past decades, our IOL technology has continued to improve, particularly with the ability to address presbyopia.\nToday we are fortunate to have three FDA-approved diffractive IOL designs that provide a full range of uncorrected vision for our cataract surgery patients. With these new options, we anticipate a greater uptake and patient acceptance to the benefits of these IOL designs. \nFigure 1. This patient had a visually significant cortical cataract causing glare with a preoperative refractive error of +3 D and then underwent cataract surgery with a trifocal IOL. The visual results were great, and the patient was happy with the net improvement in vision.\nSource: Uday Devgan, MD\nOlder design refractive multifocal IOLs were phased out about 20 years ago as new diffractive technology models came to market. These new designs provided two distinct focal points, one for near and the other for far. This worked well, and the higher add power helped to separate the two focal points to minimize dysphotopsias. We soon realized that having a near point that was so close was limiting, and then lower add IOL options became popularized. \nToday we want a full range of great vision for our patients without dependence on glasses. This requires designs that extend the range from near vision (30 cm) to intermediate vision (60 cm) and then beyond 100 cm for distance vision. To achieve this, we can adopt different diffractive IOL designs such as trifocal or those that are bifocal with extended depth of field. The net result to patients is great vision for all functional ranges without glasses. \nUday Devgan \nPatient selection for these IOLs is of paramount importance because they use optical engineering to provide the full range of vision, which is different from the youthful accommodation of the crystalline lens.\nThe concept that resonates best with my understanding of the physics is that the number of photons is fixed. This means that if I am outside walking in the moonlight on a nice summer evening, I cannot make the moon brighter. Whatever light exists in my environment is fixed, and if I focus it all at a narrow range vs. a wider range, this will affect the light distribution. Keeping in mind that retinal sensitivity tends to decrease with age, we need to carefully consider the patient\u2019s expectations. \nPatients with significant cataracts where a large portion of the incoming light is scattered or absorbed by the media opacity are much easier to please. Imagine a patient with an opaque white cataract or a dense brunescent cataract: Anything is an improvement, and these patients will be amazed with any IOL choice. On the other hand, consider a patient who has zero cataract and instead wants to exchange the crystalline lens for a diffractive full-range IOL in order to address presbyopia. This is far more challenging due to patient expectations. \nLook at the cataract of the patient and determine what percent of the incoming light is scattered or lost due to the cataract. If this value is significant, then the patient will be happy with any IOL and will potentially be thrilled with a full-range diffractive IOL.\nThe other important consideration is the patient\u2019s preoperative refraction. For patients who are plano presbyopes without cataracts, there is no perfect IOL that will make them young again. A 55-year-old plano presbyope who desires refractive lens exchange with a full-range diffractive IOL is a big challenge. A patient like this may already have 20/20 distance vision with very high optical quality, only desiring to address the presbyopia without affecting the distance vision. That is a challenge because these IOL technologies may not be able to provide the same distance vision, particularly at night, compared with the clear crystalline lens. \nAnother similar challenge is the 55-year-old patient without cataractous changes who is a \u20132 D myope. This patient tells you to just fix her distance vision because her near vision is already great. This is not the same as a 25-year-old \u20132 D myope who wants LASIK because this young patient still has a huge degree of accommodation. For this patient, the refractive status of \u20132 D provides amazing near vision that no other 55-year-old patient has and that no diffractive IOL can deliver while aiming for plano. \nNow consider the patient who is 55 years old but is a +3 D hyperope with no cataractous changes. This patient is impaired at all ranges of vision currently, using +3 D for distance vision and then +5 D for near vision. If we implant a full-range diffractive IOL in this patient, the improvement in vision will be dramatic, and the patient will be happy.\nFor the new generation of full-range or trifocal diffractive IOLs, as long as we choose patients who have significant lens opacities and/or have favorable refractive errors, we can deliver an improvement in vision that is sure to make them happy.\nFor a video of this topic, please visit https://cataractcoach.com/category/refractive-surgery-refractions/.\nFor more information:\nUday Devgan, MD, in private practice at Devgan Eye Surgery and a partner at Specialty Surgical Center in Beverly Hills, California, can be reached at devgan@gmail.com; website: www.CataractCoach.com.\nPublished by: \nSources/Disclosures\nCollapse\nSource: Expert Submission \nDisclosures: Devgan reports owning CataractCoach.com, which is a free teaching website. \nOctober 23, 2024\n4 min read\nSeptember 23, 2024\n3 min read\nAugust 21, 2024\n4 min read\nJanuary 09, 2024\n3 min read\nJanuary 09, 2024\n3 min read\nJanuary 09, 2024\n3 min read\nDecember 21, 2023\n3 min read\nAdd topic to email alerts \nPlease provide your email address to receive an email when new articles are posted on Cataract Surgery in Ophthalmology. \nAdded to email alerts \nYou've successfully added Cataract Surgery in Ophthalmology to your alerts.

If you continue to have this issue please contact customerservice@slackinc.com.\nInflammation is associated with every surgical procedure.\nIn most surgical specialties, postoperative inflammation is considered an expected part of the healing process. The associated discomfort and swelling are treated with cold compresses and oral analgesic medications, but the surgical site inflammation itself is not treated. In ophthalmology, postsurgical inflammation is associated with undesirable discomfort, photophobia and reduced visual function, recently labeled as surgical temporary ocular discomfort syndrome (STODS) by a consensus panel of experts. In addition, unique to the eye, intraocular inflammation after surgery can result in corneal endothelial cell death, trabecular meshwork damage, peripheral anterior or posterior synechiae, IOL precipitates, posterior capsular fibrosis with opacity and visually significant cystoid macular edema (CME). For this reason, ophthalmic surgeons treat postoperative inflammation aggressively.\nI have a special interest in the prevention and management of STODS and postoperative ocular inflammation. As a busy ophthalmic surgeon, clinical investigator, medical advisory board member and company consultant for 50 years, I participated in many clinical trials on the prevention and management of postoperative ocular discomfort and inflammation. Some of the findings have been published, but many have not. In the following paragraphs, I will share a few of my learnings.\nThe most useful therapeutic agents currently available for the treatment of ocular postsurgical discomfort and inflammation include topical lubricants, topical and injected steroids, and topical NSAIDs. Occasionally, topical cycloplegics or anti-VEGF intravitreal injections are indicated.\nSome level of STODS is present after all ocular surgical procedures, including intravitreal injections. Most senior patients have at least mild dry eye before surgery, and all patients have surgery-induced dry eye after surgery. The use of a quality topical lubricant before and after surgery reduces STODS, improves biometry accuracy, and results in improved patient comfort and more rapid visual recovery. The use of a topical lubricant before and after surgery is routinely of benefit, underutilized and easy to add to one\u2019s routine pre- and postoperative regimen.\nAn important vision-threatening postoperative complication after ophthalmic surgical procedures is clinically significant CME. The most common procedure a comprehensive ophthalmologist performs is cataract removal and IOL implantation, so I will focus my comments on CME after this procedure. A good paper published on this topic by Chu and colleagues reviewed 81,984 cataract surgeries performed in the United Kingdom. Data on U.S. surgery from the IRIS Registry are also available on the internet. Visually significant CME was observed in 0.8% (U.S.) and 1.17% (U.K.) of eyes after uncomplicated cataract surgery in a patient without special risk factors. The top five risk factors that increased CME risk were diabetes (10% to 20%, depending on diabetic retinopathy severity), preoperative uveitis (5% to 10%, depending on uveitis severity), epiretinal membrane (5.6%), retinal vein occlusion (4.47%) and posterior capsular rupture (2.61%). Eyes with these five risk factors and a few other rarer diagnoses such as retinitis pigmentosa deserve aggressive preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative therapy to reduce the risk for CME and treat it when present.\nA few personal thoughts on the prophylaxis and therapy of CME. Both steroids and NSAIDs are effective in reducing the risk for CME and treating it when diagnosed. As a single agent, topical NSAIDs are superior to topical steroids. The two agents used in combination are better than either alone, so a combined topical steroid/NSAID regimen is preferred, especially in high-risk cases. Preoperative treatment for 2 to 3 days can help reduce the incidence of postoperative CME. Continuing treatment for 6 to 8 weeks after surgery rather than the routine 3 to 4 weeks is helpful in high-risk patients. Good evidence supports the use of a subconjunctival injection of triamcinolone at the completion of surgery in patients with diabetes and other high-risk factors to prevent and, when present, treat clinically significant CME. Omidria (Rayner), which contains phenylephrine and ketorolac, added to surgical balanced salt irrigating solution can reduce intraoperative miosis and postoperative discomfort. Intracameral injection of a steroid and NSAID along with antibiotic at the completion of surgery is used by many surgeons (Dex-Moxi-Ketor PF, Imprimis). Intravitreal injection of triamcinolone and occasionally an anti-VEGF can rescue patients unresponsive to topical steroids and NSAIDs along with subconjunctival/sub-Tenon\u2019s triamcinolone. Fortunately, we now have non-preserved Triesence (triamcinolone acetonide injectable suspension, Harrow) labeled for ocular use available again.\nPostsurgical inflammation in the eye, the associated STODS and secondary ocular complications are preventable in many cases and, when present, treatable in the majority of patients. Effective therapy includes preoperative, intraoperative and postoperative topical over-the-counter ocular lubricants and prescription pharmaceutical agents, especially steroids and NSAIDs.\nReference:\nChu CJ, et al.

If you continue to have this issue please contact customerservice@slackinc.com.\nTraumatic iris repair is not uncommon.\nIridodialysis, iris tissue loss and iris prolapse are noted in eye trauma. Lens damage will need phacoemulsification with IOL implantation, and coexisting iris damage should be addressed simultaneously for functional and anatomical outcomes. Recently, single-pass four-throw (SFT) pupilloplasty has been used for various indications of iris-pupil diaphragm repair. In this column, we discuss a few modifications in SFT.\nFigures 1a and 1b. Single-pass four-throw pupilloplasty using polypropylene suture.\nSource: Dhivya Ashok Kumar, MD, FRCS, FICO, FAICO, and Amar Agarwal, MS, FRCS, FRCOphth\nSFT pupilloplasty\nThe conventional SFT technique has been described in various literature and studies. To brief, the tip of a 9-0 or 10-0 polypropylene suture needle is passed via a corneal side-port incision across the iris leaflet while the other end of the iris leaflet is held with end-opening forceps (Figures 1a and 1b). This needle is then docked into the barrel of the 26-gauge needle that is then eventually pulled out from the anterior chamber, and this facilitates the exit of the needle from the anterior chamber. A Sinskey hook or end-opening forceps is passed from the paracentesis incision, and pulling the suture end from the exit site creates a loop outside. The suture end is passed through the loop four times. Both suture ends are then pulled from either side, and this leads to sliding of the helical loop inside the anterior chamber, thereby approximating the iris defect; the suture ends are then cut with microscissors.\nPinhole pupilloplasty\nPinhole optics enhance visual acuity and quality. The same technique is utilized in pinhole pupilloplasty (PPP), which is a modification of SFT to make the pupil the size of a pinhole. This helps to filter out stray light from the periphery of the cornea in cases with higher-order corneal aberrations, reduces overall optical aberrations, and improves both visual acuity and image quality. In this method, the pupil size is reduced to 1.3 mm to 1.5 mm as decided by the patient from the preoperative template. The optimum pinhole size is planned from examining the pinhole vision in patients using pinhole template sizes from 1 mm to 2 mm in 0.5 mm increments. PPP has shown good functional results (Figures 2a and 2b) in eyes with corneal ectasia, post-traumatic irregular astigmatism, corneal scars and post-refractive surgery irregular corneas.\nFigure 2. Pinhole pupilloplasty in an eye with higher-order corneal aberrations (a) and anterior segment OCT (b). \nReverse SFT pupilloplasty\nReverse SFT helps in burying the Prolene sutures in the leaflets of the iris to prevent the cut ends of the knots from protruding into the anterior chamber. The long cut end of the Prolene knots can induce inflammation in the anterior chamber or rub the endothelium. This is prevented by changing or reversing the position of the iris knot.\nTrocar-assisted iris repair\nThe technique described involves placement of a 25-gauge trocar at the limbus wherein the lumen of the cannula works as a guide to introduce a double-arm polypropylene suture attached to the long arm needle, thereby preventing any accidental entrapment of corneal fibers into the needle (Figure 3). The technique allows iridodialysis repair in technically challenging situations by directing the needle appropriately and preventing any undulating movement inside the anterior chamber. As the needle passes in, it is secured in the cannula, thereby preventing undue endothelial touch and future specular loss. The remaining SFT steps are performed in a similar manner as described earlier in literature.\nFigure 3. Trocar-assisted iris repair where the suture needle is passed through the trocar cannula in the anterior chamber. \nTwofold iris repair\nAmar Agarwal \nThis is performed in a large iridodialysis with nonappositional iris damage from insertion. The iris tissue is initially repositioned inside the anterior chamber after injection of viscoelastic to form the anterior chamber. A trocar anterior chamber maintainer is useful for anterior chamber maintenance in such scenarios. Once positioned, a 10-0 double-arm suture attached to a long straight needle is passed through the base of the disinserted iris tissue. The 10-0 needle is passed through the scleral wall at approximately 1.5 mm from the limbus. The second arm of the suture is passed through the iris tissue adjacent to the previous pass. The edge of the iris tissue is held with end-opening forceps to facilitate the passage of a 10-0 needle. The knot is then tied, and the iris tissue is apposed to the scleral wall. Another double-arm 10-0 suture attached to the long needle is passed through the adjacent iris tissue, and nonappositional repair is performed. The procedure is performed to reattach all around the iris dialysis clock hours to appose the iris.\nTrifold method\nIn the trifold method, as the name suggests, three steps are involved. This is done for nonappositional iris repair. The first two steps are to reduce the distance between the two disinserted flaps by attaching the ends by trocar-assisted iris repair to the sclera, and the third step is for pupil reformation by SFT (Figures 4a and 4b).\nFigure 4. Trifold method involves two appositional sutures using trocar-assisted iris repair (a) followed by single-pass four-throw pupilloplasty for pupil reformation (b). \nSFT pupilloplasty suture lysis\nPostoperatively, if a patient has a small pupil affecting the visual field or causing an illumination defect, the suture can be lysed by YAG laser photocoagulation, and the pupil size can be titrated or enhanced. Augmentation laser lysis can be performed depending upon the visual acuity and the visual quality in follow-up.\nSFT pupilloplasty reversibility\nEyes with severe postoperative inflammation due to Prolene suture or that required retinal surgery for diabetic retinopathy or vitreoretinal disorders are the scenarios that may rarely require removal of SFT suture. This can be performed without difficulty during retinal surgery under local anesthesia.\nConclusion\nSingle-pass four-throw pupilloplasty is an easy technique with a short learning curve. Among many other iris repair methods, SFT has its own modifications for various clinical scenarios. This can be combined with keratoplasty procedures and transscleral-fixated or glued IOLs as well. Thus, SFT has evolved over the years with modifications and adaptations for new clinical situations and has shown good anatomical and functional results.\nReferences:\nAgarwal A, et al.
